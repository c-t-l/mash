Capturing audio (.wav) from target using a link

![hello](https://github.com/c-t-l/Say-Hello/blob/master/IMG_20200722_081219.jpg)

### How it works?

After the user grants microphone permissions, a website redirect button of your choice is released to distract the target while small audio files (about 4 seconds in wav format) are sent to the attacker.

It uses Recorderjs, plugin for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes (https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs)

### Features:

Port Forwarding using Ngrok
